This is a simple unit converter I made to learn React Native.

It converts selected metric units into closely matching customary units.
The user inputs a number and selects a unit to convert.
The app then displays a conversion.

To run this app, one must have node.js, python 2.7, jdk8, and Android Studio installed.

Configure with this tutorial. Go to the tab, "Building Projects with Native Code."

When opening Android Studio, choose to open an existing project and select one of the gradle files in the android directory.

The virtual machine used for testing emulated a Nexus 4 with Android 6.0 and API 23.
